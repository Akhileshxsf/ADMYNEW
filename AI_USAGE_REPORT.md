# AI Usage Report

## AI Tools Used

- **ChatGPT**: My main assistant for architecture planning, Tailwind component design, and animations.
- **v0.dev**: Helped generate starter UI components.
- **GitHub Copilot**: Assisted with repetitive code, such as props and layout logic.

## Sample Prompts Used

1. "Design a glassmorphism pricing card with Tailwind and Framer Motion animations."
2. "Give me a hero section layout with CTA, subtext, and background gradient for a SaaS tool."
3. "Explain how to set up Next.js 14 static export and fix `.next` folder issues."

## AI vs Manual Work Split

- **AI-generated (~40%)**
  - Component scaffolding (cards, buttons, sections)
  - Animations (Framer Motion scroll effects)
  - Some Tailwind utility structure and responsive classes

- **Manual coding (~60%)**
  - Integrating all components into a cohesive layout
  - Customizing the styles, animation timing, and responsiveness
  - Building the interactive Pricing Calculator (Bonus Feature)
  - Fixing build issues with `.next` folder and Netlify deployment

## Customization & Iteration

While AI gave me a great foundation for most UI components, I spent time tweaking visual design and layout for a clean, premium look. I studied SaaS design references from Vercel, Notion, and Linear to guide my decisions. I also added a **bonus Pricing Calculator** and started trying **Task A (analytics dashboard)** briefly to reuse some UI parts and see how the two tasks could merge.

AI tools helped save time, debug quickly, and generate fast design options â€” but final quality came from manual testing, refactoring, and design sense.
